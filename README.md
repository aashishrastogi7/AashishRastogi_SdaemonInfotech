This is my solution to the coding challenge described in the PDF. I’ve built a simple Web API using ASP.NET Core that supports full CRUD operations. The focus was on writing clean, understandable code with a clear structure.

Tech Stack
.NET 8

SQLite 8.0.16

Entity Framework Core

Swagger – for testing and API documentation

JetBrains Rider – IDE used for development

GitHub – version control

Key Points
Clean folder structure and code organization.

Uses Entity Framework Core with a code-first approach.

Swagger is set up for testing the endpoints quickly.

Comments are included throughout the code to explain what was done and why — to give insight into the thinking behind the implementation.
